# Shared Libraries Dashboards

This directory stores observability assets that accompany the shared libraries feature.

- `grafana/`: Dashboard JSON files for correlating logs, metrics, and traces emitted by the shared libraries.
- `alerts/`: Alertmanager/SLO templates and runbook links for telemetry guardrails.

Artifacts here are referenced by the implementation plan and will be populated during later phases (e.g., Phase 6 polish). Keep placeholders under version control so downstream tasks have stable targets.
