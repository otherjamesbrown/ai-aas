# Infrastructure Tests

Placeholder for infrastructure test suites:

- `terratest/` – Provisioning and policy validation tests.
- `synthetics/` – Availability probes and smoke checks.
- `perf/` – Capacity and load validation harnesses.

Populate these directories in later phases when implementing the associated tasks.
