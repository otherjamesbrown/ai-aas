# AI-AAS Platform

> Spec-driven repository for an inference-as-a-service platform built on Akamai Linode infrastructure with Go-based microservices, GitHub Actions automation, and declarative GitOps workflows.

This file highlights the most relevant specifications, plans, and external references so agents can reason about the project without crawling the entire repository.

## ⚠️ Critical GitHub Actions Guidelines

**MUST FOLLOW** when working with workflows:
- Reusable workflows MUST be at `.github/workflows/` top level (no subdirectories)
- Never use `${{ env.VAR }}` in reusable workflow call parameters (use hardcoded values)
- Always declare job dependencies in `needs:` if accessing outputs
- Scripts must be executable: `chmod +x` before committing
- Workflows must exist on `main` before `workflow_dispatch` works on feature branches
- See `docs/platform/github-actions-guide.md` for complete guide

## Core Specs

- [000 Plan](./specs/000-project-setup/plan.md): Tooling choices (Go 1.21, GNU Make 4.x, GitHub Actions, Linode S3-compatible storage) and structure decisions.
- [000 Quickstart](./specs/000-project-setup/quickstart.md): Onboarding steps, remote CI usage, metrics workflow, Linode API pointers.
- [001 Infrastructure Spec](./specs/001-infrastructure/spec.md): Multi-environment LKE provisioning, security baseline, observability, and rollback requirements.
- [001 Plan](./specs/001-infrastructure/plan.md): Terraform/Helm architecture, GitOps flow, directory layout, and constitution compliance for infrastructure.
- [001 Quickstart](./specs/001-infrastructure/quickstart.md): Terraform/Helm bootstrap, secrets sync, sample service validation, rollback procedures.
- [001 Contracts](./specs/001-infrastructure/contracts/): Access package schema, Terraform module interface, environment handoff OpenAPI.
- [001 Tasks](./specs/001-infrastructure/tasks.md): Executable backlog covering provisioning pipelines, observability baselines, security guardrails, and rollback drills.
- [001 Research & Data Model](./specs/001-infrastructure/research.md), (./specs/001-infrastructure/data-model.md): Provider selections, secrets strategy, entity relationships, environment lifecycle.
- [Remote CI Runbook](./docs/runbooks/ci-remote.md): Step-by-step guide for `make ci-remote`, expected SLA, troubleshooting.
- [Service Automation Guide](./docs/services/customizing.md): Shared Make template hooks, flags, and customization patterns.
- Sample services: `hello-service` (CLI greeting) and `world-service` (HTTP JSON endpoint) demonstrate build/test/check workflows.
- [Constitution](./memory/constitution.md): Non-negotiable architecture principles (API-first, LKE Kubernetes, GitOps, security gates).
