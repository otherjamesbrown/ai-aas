# AI-AAS Platform

> Spec-driven repository for an inference-as-a-service platform built on Akamai Linode infrastructure with Go-based microservices, GitHub Actions automation, and declarative GitOps workflows.

This file highlights the most relevant specifications, plans, and external references so agents can reason about the project without crawling the entire repository.

## ⚠️ Critical GitHub Actions Guidelines

**MUST FOLLOW** when working with workflows:
- Reusable workflows MUST be at `.github/workflows/` top level (no subdirectories)
- Never use `${{ env.VAR }}` in reusable workflow call parameters (use hardcoded values)
- Always declare job dependencies in `needs:` if accessing outputs
- Scripts must be executable: `chmod +x` before committing
- Workflows must exist on `main` before `workflow_dispatch` works on feature branches
- See `docs/platform/github-actions-guide.md` for complete guide

## Core Specs

- [000 Project Setup Spec](./specs/000-project-setup/spec.md): Repository structure, automation requirements, remote CI workflow (`make ci-remote`).
- [000 Plan](./specs/000-project-setup/plan.md): Tooling choices (Go 1.21, GNU Make 4.x, GitHub Actions, Linode S3-compatible storage) and structure decisions.
- [000 Quickstart](./specs/000-project-setup/quickstart.md): Onboarding steps, remote CI usage, metrics workflow, Linode API pointers.
- [Remote CI Runbook](./docs/runbooks/ci-remote.md): Step-by-step guide for `make ci-remote`, expected SLA, troubleshooting.
- [Service Automation Guide](./docs/services/customizing.md): Shared Make template hooks, flags, and customization patterns.
- Sample services: `hello-service` (CLI greeting) and `world-service` (HTTP JSON endpoint) demonstrate build/test/check workflows.
- [Constitution](./memory/constitution.md): Non-negotiable architecture principles (API-first, LKE Kubernetes, GitOps, security gates).
