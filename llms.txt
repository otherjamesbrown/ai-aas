# AI-AAS Platform

> Spec-driven repository for an inference-as-a-service platform built on Akamai Linode infrastructure with Go-based microservices, GitHub Actions automation, and declarative GitOps workflows.

This file highlights the most relevant specifications, plans, and external references so agents can reason about the project without crawling the entire repository.

## ⚠️ Critical GitHub Actions Guidelines

**MUST FOLLOW** when working with workflows:
- Reusable workflows MUST be at `.github/workflows/` top level (no subdirectories)
- Never use `${{ env.VAR }}` in reusable workflow call parameters (use hardcoded values)
- Always declare job dependencies in `needs:` if accessing outputs
- Scripts must be executable: `chmod +x` before committing
- Workflows must exist on `main` before `workflow_dispatch` works on feature branches
- See `docs/platform/github-actions-guide.md` for complete guide
